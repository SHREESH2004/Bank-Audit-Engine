  <h1>Web Technology Lab</h1>

  <p>
    In this course, we explore the foundations of web development.
    <b>HTML</b> is the backbone of every web page, providing structure and content.
    <i>CSS</i> is the styling language that makes web pages visually appealing and responsive.
    <u>Web Development</u> is the practice of building and maintaining websites and web applications
    for the internet or an intranet.

  <!--
    EXPLANATION:
    - <h1> creates the largest heading, used for the main page title.
    - <b> is applied to "HTML" to make it bold.
    - <i> is applied to "CSS" to make it italic.
    - <u> is applied to "Web Development" to underline it.
    These formatting tags visually differentiate the keywords in the paragraph.
